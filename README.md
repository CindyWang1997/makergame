# MakerGame

MakerGame is a C-like language specialized for entity and game-loop driven programs. It comes with a bare-bones library for 2D rendering and input, making it well suited for 2D games.

Based off a compiler for MicroC, a stripped-down subset of C, this repository contains a MakerGame compiler written in OCaml, a basic standard library linking to external functions (e.g., libc or SFML) and providing sensible defaults (e.g. objects for 2D games, key input classes), and the C++ source code for a runtime.

This was a semester-long [programming languages class](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2017/4115-fall/) project. For more information, including installation instructions and tutorial, see [here](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2017/4115-fall/reports/MakerGame.pdf).
